Purpose of this app:
With more people stuck at home, infected with Covid-19, many cannot get the required medication and necessities from their local pharmacies. MediGo is an app created to help people through their tough times, allowing them to order whatever they need with just a simple press of a button, all from the comfort of their bedroom. It allows the user to select one of the pharmacies near them, select the products they need and have these products delivered to their house. This app takes inspiration from Uber and the UI created by byProgrammers.
